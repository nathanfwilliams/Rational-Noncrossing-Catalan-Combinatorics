abstract: >-
  We solve two open problems in Coxeter--Catalan
  combinatorics. First, we introduce a family of
  rational noncrossing objects for any finite Coxeter
  group, using the combinatorics of distinguished
  subwords. Second, we give a type-uniform proof for
  Weyl groups that these noncrossing Catalan objects
  are counted by the rational Coxeter--Catalan
  number, using the character theory of the
  associated Hecke algebra and the properties of
  Lusztig's exotic Fourier transform.  We solve the
  same problems for rational noncrossing parking
  objects.
